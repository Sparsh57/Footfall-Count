# Footfall-Count
A footfall detection system developed using Python and YOLOv8 to monitor and record the number of people entering and exiting a specific area in real-time. This system utilizes object detection, tracking, and geometric algorithms to determine movement direction across a predefined line. The data is stored in a database for further analysis.
